Hi, I’m Nikita Tysiachnyi - a software engineer based in Düsseldorf, Germany.

I started this blog to document what I’m learning, keep handy references for myself, and occasionally share ideas that might help others. Expect posts about TypeScript, React/Next.js, Python, backend services, cloud tooling, and the small habits that make building products more enjoyable.

Why I’m writing here:

- To clarify my own thinking by writing
- To keep notes I’ll want to revisit later
- To share solutions that saved me time

If you’d like to say hi, head over to the [Contact](/contact) page.

Thanks for reading - Nikita
